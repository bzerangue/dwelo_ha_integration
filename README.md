# Dwelo Custom Integration for Home Assistant

This repo provides an integration to the [Dwelo](https://dwelo.com/) API for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

## Installation

This integration is in early development, so you can only install it as a [custom repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories) in [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/). The steps outlined on that page should be enough to get things up and running.

## Features

1. Thermostat: control basic functionality of thermostats connected with Dwelo.
   1. Set temperature
   2. Set mode (heat/cool)

## Limitations

First, this is in early development and very limited in functionality. I'm just doing this in my free time. You're welcome to submit a PR and I'll take a look at it when I get a chance.

Second, this is using the online Dwelo (V3) API, so it's not local. The good news about this is hopefully it will make this integration more compatible across different Dwelo installations.
